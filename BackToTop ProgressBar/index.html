        <h1>Kafka Ipsum</h1>
        <p>
          One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
          himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
          armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
          brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
          The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off
          any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of
          the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened
          to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
          although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar
          walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
          Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture
          that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in
          a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and
          fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the
          whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look
          out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard
          hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep
          a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but
          that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping
          on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that
          position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always
          rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times,
          shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering
          legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there
          that he had never felt before.

          "Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've
          chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes
          much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of
          that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train
          connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all
          the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly
          with them. It can all go to Hell!" He felt a slight itch up on his
          belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so
          that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw
          that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't
          know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of
          his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he
          was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position.
          "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid.
          You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life
          of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during
          the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still
          sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with
          my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that
          would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think
          about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to
          the boss and told him just what I just what I think, tell him
          everything I would, let him know just what I feel.

        <h2>Some More...</h2>
        <p>
          He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be
          sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from
          up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the
          boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got
          the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five
          or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when
          I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my
          train leaves at five." And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking
          on the chest of drawers. "God in Heaven!" he thought. It was half past
          six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than
          half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung?
          He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it
          should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it
          possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True,
          he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because
          of that.

        <h2>And Then...</h2>
        <p>
          What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to
          catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of
          samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly
          fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not
          avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there
          to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report
          about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant
          was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about
          if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and
          suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet
          been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the
          medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son,
          and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the
          doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.
          And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case?
          Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for
          so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than
          usual.One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he
          found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on
          his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see
          his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
          sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to
          slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the
          size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's
          happened to me?" he thought.
