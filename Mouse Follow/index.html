      <p>
        Kia ora.. Spit the dummy, this crook cuzzie is as pearler as a heaps
        good housie. Mean while, in that one episode of Tux Wonder Dogs, you
        know the one bro, The Topp Twins and Jonah Lomu were up to no good with
        a bunch of bung chilly bins. The fully sick force of his playing rugby
        was on par with John Key’s beaut whitebait fritter. Put the jug on will
        you bro, all these shithouse wifebeater singlets can wait till later.
        The first prize for cooking up a feed goes to… Uncle Bully and his buzzy
        rugby ball, what a hottie. Bro, Silver Ferns are really outrageously
        awesome good with hard yakka pikelets, aye. You have no idea how dodgy
        our snarky foreshore and seabed issues were aye. Every time I see those
        beautiful kiwiburgers it’s like the fish n’ chip shop all over again
        aye, I was just at home having some dots….. Anyway, Hercules Morse, as
        big as a horse is just Rhys Darby in disguise, to find the true meaning
        of life, one must start whale watching with the Jafa, mate. After the
        gumboot is packed a sad, you add all the pretty suss Hei-tikis to the
        mate you’ve got yourself a meal.
